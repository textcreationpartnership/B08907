            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>His Mi≈øtris having many Suitors com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her, could not fancy any: for her Man <hi>John</hi> had ≈øtoln away her heart. The Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon of <hi>Spinhome-land</hi> woo'd her, and often ≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited with her to make her his Wife, but could not obtain her love, becau≈øe he was a Clergy-man; too much (≈øhe thought) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to his Study.

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:184514:3"/> though he was rich, yet was he too Old for hee young and lu≈øty de≈øires. A Taylor was a third man, who was almo≈øt confident of her love; but all in vain, for her man <hi>John,</hi> oh! he was the man that had ≈øo wounded her heart that ≈øhe could love no other man.</p>
            <p>She ≈øeeing the backwardne≈øs of <hi>John,</hi> her man (after many occa≈øions which ≈øhe gave him to wooe her) came at la≈øt, and told him plainly that ≈øhe loved him, which ≈øecret ≈øhe did earne≈øtly de≈øire him not to impart to any: but he very mode≈øtly blu≈øhing with a Ro≈øie colour in his Cheeks, not knowing low to expre≈øs him≈øelf <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:184514:3"/> night: thinking it long e're morning came, rejoycing to ≈øee the light appear; more to embrace her dear Servant, or rather her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øter, <hi>John.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>She going to ≈øee <hi>Bartholomew</hi> Fair, as Women u≈øe to do, to ≈øee and be ≈øeen, took her man <hi>John</hi> with her; who whil≈øt ≈øhe was talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a friend, e≈øpyed him ≈øaluting a pretty Maid, which made her own mouth water; and biting her Lips, ≈øhe left di≈øcour≈øing with her Neighbor to go to <hi>John,</hi> to prevent his further familiarity with the Maid.</p>
            <p>Afterwards ≈øhe met with the Taylor her Sweet-heart, ≈øo neat as could be, in the Fair; who de≈øiring her to drink a Cup of Wine with him, was denied again and again, but by importunity ≈øhe was per≈øwaded; and he e≈øpying the Tanner, called him into t<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e on Thur≈øday, I will give you full ≈øatisfaction: at which time they all came; and ≈øhe told them all then plainly, that ≈øhe would marry none of them, for ≈øhe had one nearer home, whom ≈øhe loved ≈øo well, that ≈øhe could not marry any other man; ≈øo they went all away very ≈øad and di≈øcontented.</p>
            <p>Night approaching, ≈øhe talked privately
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:184514:4"/> with her Man <hi>John,</hi> wooing him to marry her; which he ≈øtill through ba≈øhfulne≈øs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu≈øed: And when night approached, ≈øhe cau≈øed a ≈øpecial bed to be made for her man <hi>John</hi> to lie in; which bed was onely for ≈øpecial ≈øtrangers to lie in, or for her Husband when he was not well: and ≈øhe lay her ≈øelf in the next Chamber to him, which ≈øhe locked up, and kept the Key thereof her ≈øelf.</p>
            <p>But when ≈øhe had lain in Bed an hour or two, ≈øhe began to think it very long to lye alone; ≈øo ≈øhe aro≈øe out of her bed, and went to her man <hi>John,</hi> ≈øhivering and ≈øhaking, and lifting up his bed cloaths, he ≈øtarted; Who is there, quoth he? It is I my ≈øweet <hi>John,</hi> quoth ≈øhe, I am your Mi≈øtri≈øs; it is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream cold Night, and I, lying alone, am almo≈øt ≈øtarved in my Bed: Good <hi>John,</hi> afford me the favour of one Nights lodging by thy ≈øide, my <hi>John,</hi> I pray thee. Alas poor Mi≈øtri≈øs, quoth he, come, come lye clo≈øe: Yea, yea, quoth ≈øhe, O ≈øweet and good <hi>John;</hi> but here I leave them till the next morning.</p>
            <p>She got up very early in the morning, and calling for <hi>John</hi> her man to go abroad with her, ≈øhe took him to the Church of Saint <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholomews;</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:184514:5"/> and calling for the Pr≈øe≈øt of the place, ≈øhe, with him, per≈øwaded <hi>John</hi> that they might then be married together; which with ≈ømall intreaty he was per≈øwaded to, and ≈øo they returned home; and when they went to dinner, ≈øhe made him to ≈øit in her old husbands Chair by her ≈øelf at the end of the Table, at which his old fellow ≈øervants began to ≈ømile; and before Dinner was ended, ≈øhe took him about the neck and ki≈ø≈øed him, and told her Servants that he was her Husband, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to give him the re≈øpects due to a Ma≈øter.</p>
            <p>He al≈øo ≈øpake lovingly to them, and told them, that he would not forget that he was once their Fellow-Servant, but would de≈øerve their re≈øpects to the uttermo≈øt of his indeavour. Thus they ≈øpent the day in loving Toyings, only ≈øome over-≈øight of the Work-men withal, and at night they went to Bed.</p>
            <p>This new married Bride was the next morning vi≈øited by divers Go≈ø≈øips of her acqu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And indeed ≈øhe began to grow as great a Go≈ø≈øip as any was in <hi>Newberry,</hi> and would ≈øometimes come home very late at night; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øomuch, that at la≈øt her Husband <hi>John</hi> went to bed, and locked her out, and took the Key up into his own Chamber; and when the good wife ≈øaw that ≈øhe was ≈øhut out of doors, ≈øhe knocked very hard, till at la≈øt her Husband looked out at the window, and bad her to go look her lodging at night, where ≈øhe had been ≈øitting all day: <hi>Such Go≈ø≈øips</hi> (quoth he) <hi>as you, the Cage is the fitte≈øt Lodging for, go to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtable, and be≈øpeak a bed of him.</hi>

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:184514:6"/> the goound for it: and ≈øhe the mean time ≈øtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in, clapped to the door, and ≈øhut him out; whereat he was much perplexed, and knocked a long time in the cold before ≈øhe would an≈øwer, who at la≈øt opening the Window, bad him go look a Lodging with him Con≈øtables Wife; and asked him whether he thought it good to lye in the cold in the Street: Now (quoth ≈øhe) ≈øhe who was even now at your mercy, hath gotten you at hers. Oh ≈øweet Wife, quoth he, be not angry, but let me come in; I ≈øwear unto thee, that I will never ≈øhut thee forth of doors again, but thou ≈øhalt do what thou wilt and I will never meddle no make with you what≈øoever you do hereafter: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ≈øhe came down and opened the door, and let him in; and there they made great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te≈øtations each to other, never to affront or fall out one with the other after; and with a good Sack-po≈ø≈øet the Covenant was agreed between them.</p>
            <p>Shortly after the King was to rai≈øe an Army of Souldiers again≈øt the Scots, who was ri≈øen again≈øt the Engli≈øh; and <hi>Jack</hi> of <hi>Newberry</hi> rai≈øed at his own charges an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty men, and allowed white Coats red Caps, and yellow Feathers; and led

            <p>Now was his Wife, who before for dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine≈øs would not foul her fingers, nor turn her head a≈øide for fear of rumpling her Nem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinger,

            <p>But when her husband e≈øpyed <hi>Jack</hi> of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry</hi> his Creditor, he ran away as fa≈øt as he could, for fear of being arre≈øted: but he ≈øent h s man after him; who ≈øeeing one pur≈øue him, he ran the fa≈øter; and in running, here he lo≈øt one of his ≈ølip-≈øhooes, and there ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ever looking behind him with great fear: At la≈øt his Breeches being tyed but with one point, that with the ha≈øte he made, and the oldne≈øs thereof, brake, and his Breeches fell about his heels, and did ≈øo ≈øhackle him, that he fell down all along in the Street which his Ar≈øe bare, and an old ragged Shirt, he lay ≈øweating and blowing, being quite worn out of breath; to whom the fellow came, and brought him to his Ma≈øter, who took him to a Scrivener, to give him Bond for the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the money; and the time of the payment of the money was to be paid when the ≈øaid <hi>Pert</hi> was Sheriff of <hi>London,</hi> a thing very unlikely.</p>
